# Portly for the Mac App Store

This target is intentionally separate from the full Portly distribution. It is an App Sandbox-compliant controller for a Portly service already running on the same Mac.

- It communicates only with `http://127.0.0.1:7737`.
- It does not embed Sparkle, install a CLI, launch shell commands, inspect ports, or read project files.
- The full Developer ID distribution remains the process supervisor and source of truth.
- When the local service is unavailable, **Explore Demo** presents sample projects and
  simulated Start, Stop, and Restart controls so App Review can evaluate the complete
  companion without installing the full Portly distribution.

Generate and validate the project with:

```bash
cd StoreApp
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project PortlyCompanion.xcodeproj -scheme PortlyCompanion -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```
